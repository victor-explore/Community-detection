# Community Detection Project

## Overview
This project implements and analyzes community detection algorithms on social network datasets. The main focus is on the Girvan-Newman algorithm and the Louvain method for identifying communities within graph structures.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to apply community detection techniques to real-world social network data, specifically the LastFM Asia dataset. The project aims to:
1. Implement the Girvan-Newman algorithm for community detection
2. Implement one iteration of the Louvain algorithm
3. Visualize and analyze the resulting community structures

## Datasets
- LastFM Asia social network dataset

## Algorithms Implemented
1. Girvan-Newman Algorithm
   - Full implementation with dendrogram visualization
2. Louvain Method
   - Single iteration implementation

## Files in the Repository
- `Untitled-1.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the implementation and analysis
- `Untitled-1 - Copy.ipynb`: Backup or alternative version of the main notebook
- `Community Detection Assignment_v1.pdf`: Detailed problem statement and assignment guidelines

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, networkx, matplotlib, collections

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure all required libraries are installed
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks to see the implementation and results

## Results
The project provides:
- Community matrix for the LastFM Asia dataset using the full Girvan-Newman algorithm
- Dendrogram visualization of the communities obtained
- Graph partition results from one iteration of the Louvain algorithm

## Future Work
- Implement full Louvain method with multiple iterations
- Compare results with other community detection algorithms
- Extend analysis to other social network datasets
